Do not remove this file if you have installed PICkitminus under Program Files
or similar location without write permission.

This file indicates that the .ini file should be saved to Appdata\Local
directory. Without this file, the .ini file will be saved to same directory
where the PICkitminus.exe file is. This allows to make 'portable' version
of PICkitminus, so the settings are kept in same directory as the software.
